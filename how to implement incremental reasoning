How to implement incremental reasoing;

Tables that need to always be cleaned:
  extracted_profiles

Tables that need to be cleaned when there is a clean load:
  extracted_profiles
  existing_profiles
  existing_tables
  existing_types

1) Divide the method gs_guess_candidate_types into
  extract_profiles>
		which will include the code up to deduplification of profiles (table extracted_profiles), only the step that initialised the table comp_types_from_guesses

  match_profiles>
		which will check for matches between extracted_profiles and existing_profiles
		
		for each match extracted_profiles.concept_list=existing_profiles.concept_list and extracted_profiles.guess_list=existing_profiles.guess_list 
		    update link_individual_profiles.profile_id=existing_profiles.profile_id
		    where link_individual_profiles.profile_id=extracted_profiles.profile_id
	      
		    delete the row from extracted_profiles

  initialise_base_type_computation>
		//keep in mind now we have only unmatched profiles
		for each profile in extract_profiles
		    insert into existing_profiles
		    insert into comp_types_from_guesses the existing profile (same code as in the current gs_guess_candidate_types, in order to initialize the computation table)

2)Add a step that updates the link with initial_type_ids of the introduced profiles, after the computation of initial_types is finished
/*in this step we store the link between the profile_id and initial_type_ids generated by process of generating candidate types*/
  update_profile_ini_types_link>
		for each match existing_profiles.profile_id=comp_types_from_guesses.profile_id 
		    update existing_profiles.ini_type=comp_types_from_guesses.ini_type_id

3) Update the encoding 2 datalog, to retreive the link between the ini_types and existing_profiles from the existing_profiles_table

4) When the abox_types are initialized, copy the existing_types and existing_knots to the type and knots table. 

5) When the computation is completed, copy the data back from types and knots to existing_types and existing_knots tables
